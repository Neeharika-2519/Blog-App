            <p>Welcome to Neeharika's Blog! This blog was created by Vijaya Neeharika Rangisetty
              as a personal project to share thoughts and ideas with the
              world. Neeharika is a passionate developer who loves to work on designing and sketching.</p>
            <p>What I love most about front-end development is the ability to design and style web pages. Crafting intuitive and engaging user interfaces is where I excel, and I find immense satisfaction in bringing design concepts to life through code.
            My skills in digital sketching and web design further complement my front-end expertise, allowing me to create visually stunning and user-friendly websites.</p>
